This code takes input from a file (data.txt) and prints the items to the user. The program will
then flip the array backwards and print that to the user. Then finally, the code will count the
number of ones, number of zeros, and number of ones AND zeros. After counting and calcuating,
the program will then print the amounts to the user.
