Porblem 1 - Gets a value from the user that the user wishes to find the factorial of. The 
            program checks if that number is valid (valid being defined as nonnegtive integers 
            less than 8), and then runs the user value through R.W. Gosper's proposed 
            approximation formula for the factorial of a value.

Problem 2 - This is a program that calculates the speed of sound in air at a given temperature.

Problem 3 - This is a program that acts as a automatic teller machine that dispenses money.

Problem 4 - This is a program that determines whether a quadratic equation has one real root, 
            two real roots, or imaginary roots. Then, if the roots are real, display the roots 
            of the quadratic equation.
