
 This program finds the number of roots whether or not that
 that those roots are real or imaginary. Use the following
 format to determine those coefficients:

         ax^2 + bx + c = 0

 Enter the coefficient for a:   2

 a = 2.000

 Enter the coefficient for b:   8

 b = 8.000

 Enter the coefficient for c:   8

 c = 8.000

 There is only one real root.
        X1 = -2.000

 Enter 1 for yes and 0 for now: 1

 Enter the coefficient for a:   -5

 a = -5.000

 Enter the coefficient for b:   3

 b = 3.000

 Enter the coefficient for c:   -4

 c = -4.000

 There are two imaginary roots.
        X1 = -0.543i
        X2 = 1.143i

 Enter the coefficient for b:   7

 b = 7.000

 Enter the coefficient for c:   4

 c = 4.000

 There are two real roots.
        X1 = -0.500
        X2 = 4.000
