Problem 1 - In this code, a file will be read ( mat.txt ) and the program will read it as a matrix
            and return to the user the determinant. Program uses two functions: 1st is used a 
            welcome/into to the user, the 2nd is used to read the file, calculate the determinant, 
            and print the determinant to the screen.

Problem 2 - This program takes a file ( data.txt ) and write an array from the file. The user then 
            has the choice to sort the file in either ascending order or descending order. Each 
            step will be printed to the user as it is sorted.
